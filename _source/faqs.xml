	<Topic data="System Requirements">
		<Question data="What are the software requirements for the SignagePlayer?">
			<Answer data="Our software requirements are amazingly simple, allowing anyone to use almost any computer.&lt;BR&gt; SignageStudio - Desktop or web
				 version -
				Any computer, witn any OS, running a commonly supported web browser with Flash player 10+ or above.
				SignagePlayer - web version -  Any commonly supported web browser running Flash player 10+ or above ( Any OS or device )
				&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
				SignagePlayer, - desktop version - Any OS which runs Adobe integrated runtime including Linux/Ubuntu, Windows XP, Windows 7 or
				 above as well as Mac OS X
				&lt;BR&gt;"/>
		</Question>
		<Question data="What are the hardware requirements for the SignagePlayer?">
			<Answer data="The following is recommended for good digital signage playback which include swf animations, images, HD Video, Weather, RSS feed etc:&lt;BR&gt;
			Intel Pentium Dual Core 2.5GHz or faster Intel based processor with 1GB RAM; with 80GB hard drive. 
			This is true for all operating systems including Windows, Ubuntu and Mac.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
			You maybe be able to get away with lower end hardware, but you may also not receive the desired smoothness and miss out on the full potential of our software.
			&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
			High quality signage presentation do require higher-end hardware. If your presentation includes multiple HD Video (H.264), 
			vector based images and high-quality full screen swf animation including support for multiple screens, 
			you should invest in better performance hardware.
			&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Large monitors running high resolution screens (i.e: 1920x1080) will also require better hardware; for improved rendering and 
			high frame-per-second (FPS) refresh rate. 
			&lt;BR&gt;
			For best performance we recommend:&lt;BR&gt;
			Intel Pentium 2.8GHz Quad Core2 with 2GB of RAM&lt;BR&gt;
			&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
			&lt;BR&gt;
			Note: The SignagePlayer for the Mac OS is supported only on the Intel base player, not PowerPC!
			&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;"/>
		</Question>
		<Question data="Does the SignagePlayer run on devices with Windows XP Embedded?">
			<Answer data="The MediaSignage SignagePlayer can run on low-end devices with as little as an 800MHz processor with Win XPe SP3
				(embedded XP). Of course, you will be limited to simpler videos (no HD) and simpler swf animation
				due to the lack of processing power."/>
		</Question>
		<Question data="Which operating system do you support?">
			<Answer data="We support any OS which runs Flash Player 10+ or above.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This includes Windows 2000 with Service Pack 4; Windows XP with
				 Service Pack 2; Windows Vista Home Premium, Business, Ultimate, or Enterprise; and Windows 7 - all versions. For Linux use
				 Ubunto 9.10 or later release. Mac OS X 10.5.1 or later. Other devices such as portable and handheld are also supported as long
				 they have Flash 10+ running natively."/>
		</Question>
		<Question data="What kind of display monitors can I use?">
			<Answer data="You can use any display such as a Computer monitor, LCD or Plasma which supports PC input."/>
		</Question>
		<Question data="Do I need a fast, persistent internet connection?">
			<Answer data="Our SignageStudio and the web version of SignagePlayer do require a dedicated internet connection. However, our desktop version
				 of SignagePlayer, powered by the built-in caching engine, does not require a dedicated connection. 
				In fact, the SignagePlayer-desktop version searches for internet activity only during power up and when it searches to see if
				 new content is available for it to download. If there is no internet connection at all at these stations, you can update your
				 digital signage manually using a portable hard drive or flash memory device"/>
		</Question>
		<Question data="Do I need a static IP?">
			<Answer data="No, dynamic IPs are fully supported. In fact our system is smart enough to move into polling mode and bypass firewall restrictions if need be."/>
		</Question>
		<Question data="Which file formats do you support?">
			<Answer data="
				MediaSignage officially supports all of the Flash Media Formats which include:
				&lt;BR&gt;
				&lt;BR&gt;
				Video Formats: Flash video FLV (H.263), MPEG-4 (H.264) ,MOV, M4A, MP4V, 3GP, 3G2, AAC (HE, LC), SWF
				&lt;BR&gt;
				&lt;BR&gt;
				Animation: SWF
				&lt;BR&gt;
				&lt;BR&gt;
				Images: JPG, PNG
				&lt;BR&gt;
				&lt;BR&gt;
				Sound: MP3
				&lt;BR&gt;
				&lt;BR&gt;
				However, you should note, due to the hundreds of different encoders available today, it is possible that some of your files may
				 not run properly in your signage presentation.
				&lt;BR&gt;
				&lt;BR&gt;
				That is why we highly recommend you use a Freeware utility like Super to convert your media files to standard format including
				 FLV, PNG or SWF. This will eliminate any encoder /decoder issues you may experience. 
				You can read our conversion format document here:
				&lt;BR&gt;
				http://mediasignage.com/html/media_file_conversion.html

		<Question data="Can I connect external DVD, Satellite TV, Cable box or other input devices?">
			<Answer data="We have the capability to connect any S-Video, RCA or beautiful High Definition (HD) source (satellite, cable, security cameras etc) via a capture card. Check this video and also be sure to watch the videos on the bottom: 

http://mediasignage.com/html/digital_signage_capture.html

You can get your own capture device OR get our mediaBOX available here: http://digitalsignage.me/html/advertising_monitor.html and get the added capture card add-on device here: 

http://digitalsignage.me/html/extras.html "/>
		</Question>
		<Question data="Why is my input device blurry or squished (seeing interlace)?">
			<Answer data="To remove the interlace (to deinterlace) you must set the width and height of the screen division where the capture component resides to match the input resolution.
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
For example, for most DVD and other sources use a width and height that is a multiplier of 1.5. So try and set screen division to 720x480 and put the capture component inside that area to de-interlace.

			<Answer data="The short answer is yes.
