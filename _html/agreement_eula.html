           <p>THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS SET FORTH BELOW (THE "TERMS") GOVERN YOUR USE OF THIS SERVICE ON THE WORLD WIDE WEB. THESE TERMS ARE A LEGAL CONTRACT BETWEEN YOU AND MEDIASIGNAGE, INC. ("WE" "US") AND GOVERN YOUR ACCESS TO, AND USE OF THE MEDIASIGNAGE SERVICE LOCATED AT WWW.MEDIASIGNAGE.COM AND ANY OF ITS SERVICES DOWLOADED THROUGH THE OFFLINE PLAYER (THE "SERVICE"). IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH ANY OF THESE TERMS, DO NOT ACCESS OR OTHERWISE USE THIS SERVICE AND/OR ANY INFORMATION CONTAINED ON THE SERVICE. YOUR USE OF THIS SERVICE AND/OR THE SERVICES ON THIS SITE SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE YOUR AGREEMENT TO ABIDE BY EACH OF THE TERMS SET FORTH BELOW. MEDIASIGNAGE MAY MAKE CHANGES TO THE SERVICES OFFERED AT ANY TIME, AND MEDIASIGNAGE CAN CHANGE THESE TERMS AT ANY TIME. IF MEDIASIGNAGE CHANGES THESE TERMS, WE WILL POST A CHANGE NOTICE ON THE SERVICE AND WE MAY SEND REGISTERED MEMBERS AN EMAIL NOTICE OF THE CHANGE. YOUR CONTINUED USE OF THE SERVICE AFTER SUCH CHANGES HAVE BEEN POSTED MEANS THAT YOU AGREE TO THE NEW TERMS EVEN IF YOU HAVE NOT REVIEWED THEM.</p>

<h4>General Use Restrictions</h4>
<p>MediaSignage provides content and other services through the Service. Certain information, documents, products and services provided on and through the Service, including content, trademarks, logos, graphics and images that are not Presentations (as defined below) (together, the "Materials") are provided to you by MediaSignage and are the copyrighted work of MediaSignage or MediaSignage's contributors. The Service also provides, among other things, an online marketplace (the “Shared resources”) where you can browse and acquire content and services for use in your Presentations ("Shared resources"), which may be subject to third party license agreements. In addition, MediaSignage may make certain applications available to you on the Service for use that may assist you in developing or managing Presentations (the "Software"). Any such Software is only made available for use under the terms of a limited, non-exclusive license to use the Software on your personal computer for the sole purpose of developing or managing Presentations.</p>
<p>During the term of these Terms, MediaSignage grants you a limited, personal, non-exclusive and non-transferable license to use and to display the Materials and use the services, the Service and the Software solely for your personal use if you are an individual and solely for your business use if you are an organization or agent of your organization in connection with the creation, storage, display and arrangement of Presentations you create using the Service. You acknowledge and agree that you have no right to modify, edit, copy, reproduce, create derivative works of, reverse engineer, alter, enhance or in any way exploit any of the Materials or the Software in any manner. This limited license terminates automatically, without notice to you, if you breach any of these Terms. Upon termination of this limited license, you agree to immediately destroy any downloaded or printed Materials or Software. Except as stated herein, you acknowledge that you have no right, title or interest in or to the Service, any Materials or the Software on any legal basis.</p>

<h4>Your Registration Obligations.</h4>
<p>In consideration of your use of the Service, you represent that you are of legal age to form a binding contract and are not a person barred from receiving services under the laws of the United States or other applicable jurisdiction. You also agree to: (a) provide true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself as prompted by the Service's registration form (the "Registration Data") and (b) maintain and promptly update the Registration Data to keep it true, accurate, current and complete. If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, or MediaSignage has reasonable grounds to suspect that such information is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, MediaSignage has the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use of the Service (or any portion thereof).</p>

<p>By using all or part of this Service, you consent to receiving electronic communications from MediaSignage and its partners and affiliates. These electronic communications may include notices about applicable fees and charges, transactional information and other information concerning or related to our Service. These electronic communications are part of your relationship with MediaSignage and you receive them as part of your use of the Service. You agree that any notices, agreements, disclosures or other communications that we send you electronically will satisfy any legal communication requirements, including that such communications be in writing.</p>

<h4>Privacy Policy.</h4>
<p>Registration Data and certain other information about you is subject to our Privacy Policy. For more information, see our full privacy policy. You understand that through your use of the Service you consent to the collection and use (as set forth in the Privacy Policy) of this information, including the transfer of this information to the United States and/or other countries for storage, processing and use by MediaSignage and its affiliates.</p>

<h4>Password Restricted Areas of the Service.</h4>
<p>When a visitor to the Service registers to become a member ("Member"), he or she will select an available user name ("Membership Name") and a corresponding user password ("Membership Password") to create a unique, personal account (a "Membership Account"). The Member shall also be required to specify whether he or she is registering as an individual or on behalf of a company or entity (and, if so, the name of the company or entity). You will need a Membership Password to login to the Service and use certain functions and areas within the Service ("Restricted Areas"). If you are an authorized Member of the Restricted Areas, you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password and account, and agree to notify MediaSignage if your password is lost, stolen, or disclosed to an unauthorized third party, or otherwise may have been compromised. You are responsible for activities that occur under your account. You agree to immediately notify MediaSignage of any unauthorized use of your account or any other breach of security in relation to the Service known to you. You will not use other members' contact information gathered from Restricted Areas of the Service for commercial purposes and agree not to provide any other Member's contact information to any third party that is not a Member of MediaSignage.
</p>

<h4>Subscription / Enterprise Pricing and Changes.</h4>
<p>When a Member of the Services chooses to become a subscriber or a Enterprise, he or she will choose a subscription type and enter additional data, including payment information within their Membership Account. With respect to Software or Services provided on a subscription basis, Subscriber agrees that MediaSignage or MediaSignage's authorized resale partner, as applicable, may from time to time either increase or decrease the fee(s) for all or any portion thereof, and that any such adjustment, when made by MediaSignage or MediaSignage's authorized resale partner, as applicable, shall apply effective as of the expiration of the then-current subscription term. If Subscriber objects to any fee change, Subscriber's sole remedy shall be to elect not to renew the Software or Service at the expiration of the then-current subscription term. Each subscription term begins on the day MediaSignage receives full payment of the applicable fees from Subscriber or MediaSignage's authorized resale partner, as applicable, and expires either 14 days or 1 year later, depending on the subscription type selected in the applicable order. The subscription term will automatically renew for additional periods unless Subscriber elects not to renew on or before the expiration date. If Subscriber purchases additional subscription Software or Services, the subscription term for such additional Software or Services will be coterminous with the preexisting subscription term. The fee for any additional subscriptions purchased in the middle of a billing month will be charged in full for that billing month. Reductions will be effective at the end of the then-current term. No refunds or credit adjustments will be given. You acknowledge that MediaSignage reserves the right to limit the maximum number of free licenses and total storage capacity for each user account. Furthermore, MediaSignage, in its sole discretion, reserves the right to adjust the starting price per license. As of January 1st 2011 MediaSignage offers the mediaCLOUD Digital Signage service at no cost and does not collect the suggested $4.95 per SignagePlayer license and MediaSignage can make changes of any user account, at any time without prior notice.</p>

<h4>Payment method; Credit Card Authorization.</h4>
<p>You must provide MediaSignage or MediaSignage's authorized resale partner, as applicable, with valid credit card or approved purchase order information. MediaSignage or MediaSignage's authorized resale partner, as applicable, may require, and Subscriber agrees that such fees shall be paid by means of credit card payments or other forms of electronic funds transfers, and to implement measures enabling MediaSignage or MediaSignage's authorized resale partner, as applicable, to initiate such electronic funds transfers. If you are paying by credit card, only valid credit cards acceptable to MediaSignage or MediaSignage's authorized resale partner, as applicable, may be used by you to make payment, and all authorized refunds will be credited to the same card. Until all amounts due have been paid in full, you hereby authorize MediaSignage or MediaSignage's authorized resale partner, as applicable, to charge any credit card provided by you all amounts due under the Agreement from time to time, including without limitation, ongoing Subscription and installment and other payments, taxes, and additional fees. If the credit card cannot be verified, is invalid, is declined, or is not otherwise acceptable or if MediaSignage does not receive payment from its authorized resale partner for your purchase or subscription, the Software and Services may be terminated, deferred, suspended, or cancelled by MediaSignage without notice at MediaSignage's discretion and MediaSignage may generate invoices for payment. You agree to update your credit card information to keep it current at all times and that MediaSignage or MediaSignage's authorized resale partner, as applicable, may submit charges for processing even if the card appears to have expired. A credit card authorization form must be completed for all payments made by credit card. All prices are given and must be paid in the currency listed. All payment obligations are non-cancelable and all amounts paid are nonrefundable. Unless otherwise provided by law or in connection with any particular service offer, all charges are non-refundable.</p>

<h4>Taxes.</h4>
<p>All fees are exclusive of all taxes, fees, levies, duties or similar charges arising out of or relating to the Agreement, and you shall be responsible for payment of all such taxes, fees, levies, duties or similar fees, excluding only taxes based solely on MediaSignage's income.</p>

<h4>Conversion of Trial Period Offers.</h4>
<p>You may have received a complimentary trial Subscription to the Software or Service or some other trial period offer. Unless we notify you otherwise, if you are participating in any trial period offer, your trial period will expire at the end of the trial term and access to the Subscription-based Software or Service will be suspended. You will then be prompted to either become a Subscriber or be limited to the Member version of the Software or Services.
</p>

<h4>Shared resources</h4>
<p>A Member or Subscriber ("User") shall acquire ”Shared resource” Items through the Service, and such Marketplace Items may be subject to an applicable content download agreement based on criteria specified by such User. A User may acquire Shared resource Items for a particular use(s) only if he or she pays with the applicable number of Credits (as defined below) on the Service, and only if he or she agrees to the terms and conditions of any applicable content download agreement for such Marketplace Item and such use(s).</p>

<h4>Credits and Payments.</h4>
<p>Transactions in the Marketplace, including the purchase of products or services, shall be conducted using Marketplace credits ("Credits") in accordance with MediaSignage's pricing and payment policies and subject to any amounts that may be owed to MediaSignage with respect to such transactions. In the event you purchase a Marketplace Item, the appropriate number of Credits shall be deducted from your 
</p>

<h4>Membership Account.</h4>
<p>You may acquire Credits only by purchase, by using credit or charge cards, online payment accounts, wire transfers or such means as then permitted by MediaSignage, or by redeeming a special promotion. If you purchase any Credits using a credit or charge card or an online payment account, you represent and warrant that you are the cardholder or account holder and that the billing information provided is accurate, and you authorize MediaSignage or MediaSignage's authorized resale partner, as applicable, to charge the designated credit or charge card or online payment account for the total amount of the purchase, including any sales or similar taxes. Credits are non-refundable. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, you may never redeem Credits for cash, and can only use Credits for transactions within the Marketplace.</p>

<h4>Use of Marketplace Products and Services.</h4>
<p>You may only acquire Marketplace Items from the Service in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and of any applicable content download agreement. You may not use, reproduce, distribute, display or create derivative products or services based on any Marketplace Items or other goods or services that appear on the Service unless you enter into a content download agreement, and you may do so only to the extent expressly permitted under the terms and conditions of an applicable content download agreement.</p>
<p>You acknowledge and agree that no ownership of any Marketplace Items can be transferred, and that no sale of any Marketplace Items can be effectuated, on or through the Service. Only the rights expressly sublicensed in an applicable content download agreement are granted on or through the Service. You acknowledge and agree that MediaSignage or its third-party providers retain all ownership rights in and to the Marketplace Items, and that such Marketplace Items are protected by copyright, trademark and other intellectual property rights of MediaSignage or its third-party providers.</p>

<h4>Termination.</h4>
<p>MediaSignage may, at any time, terminate this Agreement in its sole discretion, including, without limitation, for breach by you of any of your representations, warranties or obligations under this Agreement, or for inactivity as it relates to the Service for a period of 90 days. You may, at any time, terminate this Agreement by logging into your Membership Account on the Service and selecting to cancel your MediaSignage account. In the event termination is by MediaSignage, MediaSignage shall notify you of such termination. MediaSignage reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to terminate your Membership Account at any time, including, without limitation, deactivating your Membership Name and Membership Password.</p>

<h4>Effect of Termination.</h4>
<p>Upon any termination of this Agreement:</p>
<p>(a) Your Membership Account shall be cancelled and closed and your Membership Name and Membership Password shall be deactivated;  
<p>(b) All Shared resourc</p>e Items uploaded by you shall be removed from the Service; provided, however, that MediaSignage may continue to use the Marketplace Item for internal archival and reference purposes;  </p>
<p>(c) You shall forfeit all right, title and interest in and to any and all Credits; and  </p>
<p>(d) MediaSignage will permanently delete your Presentations and Materials within 24 hours of the 
effective date of termination.</p>
<p>Termination of this Agreement shall not relieve you of any payment obligations that may have arisen prior to such termination, or any other obligations pursuant to any other agreement that has not been specifically terminated.</p>

<h4>Suspension.</h4>
<p>MediaSignage reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to suspend your Membership Account at any time and for any length of time. In the event, and for so long as, MediaSignage suspends your Membership Account, you shall have no ability to purchase any Marketplace Items or other goods or services on the Service, but you may continue to access your Membership Account using your Membership Name and Membership Password. For clarification purposes, MediaSignage shall not remove any Marketplace Items or other goods or services you have purchased prior to suspension of your Membership Account and such Marketplace Items or other goods or services shall continue to be available.</p>
